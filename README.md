# Web-Proxy
This is a simple Web Proxy made in Visual Basic.net that includes a login page where you can create your own username and password.

Default Username and Password are blank so to login you can either change it in the form, or just click the login button when you try to login.

To access the proxy configuration menu, you must go to top left of the web browser, click on file, then proxy settings, and their will you be able to use what ever proxy you would like.
